Codeclan week 6 day 3 lab, given a test file, make the functions.


# Film
## Brief

You have been given a project with two models, Cinema and Film, and their corresponding test files.

A Film has:

- a title
- a genre
- a year
- a length

A Cinema has:

- an array of Films

You should write the code to make the Cinema tests pass. You should use JavaScript’s built-in enumerator methods, only using forEach if you can’t find a way to use one of the other more appropriate methods.

**MVP**

Cinema:

- should have a collection of films
- should be able to get a list of film titles
- should be able to find a film by title
- should be able to filter films by genre
- should be able to check whether there are some films from a particular year (true/false)
- should be able to check whether all films are over a particular length (true/false)
- should be able to calculate total running time of all films

**Extensions**

- Add a another test, 'Cinema should be able to filter films by year'.
